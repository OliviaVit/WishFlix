  <h2 class="about-subtitle">About the Project</h2>

  <p class="about-text">
    This project was created by <strong>Inès OUARGHI</strong> and <strong>Olivia VITTENET</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="about-text">
    Wishflix is an interactive web application built around a TV series API. It allows you to discover and explore a wide range of TV shows with several features:
  </p>

  <ul class="about-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Main catalog:</strong> a home page displaying a catalog of series that you can sort by name, release year, or rating. You can also filter series by genre or search directly for a specific series.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Suggestions page:</strong> a dedicated secondary page where you can select your favorite genres and/or favorite series. Based on your choices, the app will generate 5 personalized movie recommendations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Detailed series view:</strong> on any page, clicking on a series opens a detailed view showing seasons, episodes, synopsis, and more.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="about-text">
    Our goal was to make discovering new series more fluid, interactive, and personalized to each user's taste.
  </p>

  <h2 class="about-subtitle">How the Suggestions System Works</h2>

  <p class="about-text">
    Our suggestion system is based on a smart filtering and scoring algorithm that combines the user’s favorite genres and selected series to deliver highly relevant recommendations.
  </p>

  <ul class="about-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Genre Selection:</strong> Users can select their favorite genres. These preferences are saved and used to filter the series catalog.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Series Favorites:</strong> Users can also pick their favorite known TV shows. The genres of these favorites are extracted to enrich the filtering process.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Smart Filtering:</strong> Each series is scored based on how many genres it shares with the selected preferences. The series that match the most criteria are prioritized.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Exclusion of Already Selected Shows:</strong> To avoid redundancy, series that have already been marked as favorites are excluded from the suggestions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Summary Similarity Algorithm:</strong> We further refine suggestions by analyzing the similarity of show summaries: series that share similar keywords with the user’s favorites get a higher score.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Final Result:</strong> The 5 best matching series are displayed, offering a personalized discovery experience based on the user's individual taste.
    </li>
  </ul>
